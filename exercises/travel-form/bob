For anyone who struggled with getting an array of all checkboxes from their Travel Form exercise, you’re probably not alone. It’s an annoying process that really feels outdated. Here’s how I would do it if I were you:

1. Give each checkbox in the list a `name` property that’s the same across every checkbox in the same category, and a `value` property that’s specific to that checkbox. So in the Travel Form, something like:

```<input type="checkbox" name="dietaryRestrictions" value="vegan">
<input type="checkbox" name="dietaryRestrictions" value="kosher">
… etc … with the associated labels too of course
```

2. In JavaScript inside your event listener, use the fancy `querySelectorAll` method to select all of the checkboxes with that name that are checked. The syntax looks like this:

```var checked = document.querySelectorAll("input[name=dietaryRestrictions]:checked")  // Saves an array of all the HTML elements with the name property of "dietaryRestrictions" that are checked.
```

3. Write a `for` loop to get the `value`s from those checked checkboxes and put them into an array of your own that contains just the `value`s of the checkboxes that were checked:

```var dietary = [];
for (var i = 0; i < checked.length; i++) {
    dietary.push(checked[i].value);
}
```

4. Now you have an array with the values from the checked boxes from your form! In only 4 easy steps… :face_with_rolling_eyes:

Full relevant code:

```<input type="checkbox" name="dietaryRestrictions" value="Kosher" id="kosher">
<label for="kosher">Kosher</label>

<br>

<input type="checkbox" name="dietaryRestrictions" value="Vegan" id="vegan">
<label for="vegan">Vegan</label>

<br>

<input type="checkbox" name="dietaryRestrictions" value="Gluten Free" id="gluten-free">
<label for="gluten-free">Gluten Free</label>

<br>

<button type="button" id="submitForm">Submit</button>
```

```document.getElementById("submitForm").addEventListener("click", function () {
    var checked = document.querySelectorAll("input[name=dietaryRestrictions]:checked");
    var dietary = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < checked.length; i++) {
        dietary.push(checked[i].value);
    }
    console.log(dietary);
});```
